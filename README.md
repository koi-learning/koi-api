*koi-api* is part of the [KOI-System](https://github.com/koi-learning) and implements its runtime environment.
The *KOI-System* is framework for lifecycle-management of machine learning solutions.
As such it allows the user to create, train, and deploy ML-solutions.
"*KOI*" is an abbreviation of the german name "Kognitive Objekt-orientierte Intelligenz", which translates to "cognitive object-oriented intelligence".

To simplify the development and deployment of different ML-solutions the system defines three types of objects: **Models**, **Instances**, and **Samples**
